üìà Stock Price Forecasting Project
1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview

This project analyzes historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and forecasts future prices using ARIMA and Prophet models.
The project demonstrates a full data analytics workflow including data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, time-series forecasting, and visualization.

Key Goals:

Understand stock price trends and volatility.

Compare ARIMA vs Prophet forecasting models.

Build a reproducible workflow suitable for dashboards or investment insights.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack

Python 3.11

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, statsmodels, prophet, scikit-learn, streamlit

Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and modeling

Streamlit (optional) for interactive dashboard

Git & GitHub for version control

4Ô∏è‚É£ Project Workflow
Step 1: Data Collection

Download historical stock price data using Yahoo Finance API (yfinance library).

Save raw data to data/AAPL_raw.csv.

Step 2: Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Convert Date column to datetime.

Add moving averages (MA7, MA30) and volatility (Volatility7, Volatility30).

Handle missing values and numeric conversion.

Save cleaned data to data/AAPL_cleaned.csv.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize closing price over time.

Plot moving averages and volatility.

Generate interactive plots using Plotly.

Save plots to images/ folder for portfolio and README.

Step 4: Forecasting Models
ARIMA Model

Fit ARIMA (5,1,0) to closing prices.

Forecast next 30 days.

Plot historical + forecasted prices and save to images/arima_forecast.png.

Prophet Model

Fit Prophet model on cleaned data.

Forecast next 365 days.

Plot trend, weekly, yearly components, and interactive forecast.

Save plots to images/prophet_forecast_interactive.png and images/prophet_components.png.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Insights

Stock Trend: Apple stock shows a strong upward trend with short-term volatility.

Moving Averages: Useful for detecting trends and smoothing price fluctuations.

Forecast Comparison: ARIMA is short-term accurate; Prophet provides long-term seasonal trends.

Interactive Visualization: Helps explore forecast patterns and components intuitively.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Run Project (Local Setup)
```
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername stock-forecasting.git
cd stock-forecasting

# 2. Create & activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run notebooks or Streamlit dashboard
jupyter notebook
# OR
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

8Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges & Solutions

Data type issues: Date column was string ‚Üí converted to datetime.

Missing values: Dropped or filled numeric columns before modeling.

Memory issues with Prophet: Limited data and used efficient indexing.

Interactive plot saving: Used plotly.write_image to save images for README.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways

Complete end-to-end time-series forecasting workflow.

Combines Python, Jupyter, ARIMA, Prophet, and visualization libraries.

Fully reproducible and portfolio-ready for recruiters.
